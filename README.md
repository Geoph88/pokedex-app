#Project 4 - Geoffdex

This is my final project for the SEI53 cohort. We had free range to build what we want so I decided to go with replicating a pokedex from the video-game series Pokemon. 

Geoffdex is a pokedex app where people can sign in and receive information about specific pokemon and can even save their own favourite pokemon.

## Get Started
As this app is a fullstack application, instructions are in the git repo for the <a href="https://github.com/Geoph88/pokedex_api"></a>pokedex_api. There are instructions there as well as both the buildfolder and code for the backend.

## General approach
I approached this by interacting with a Pokemon Api (found here) for the majority of my front-end application. I focused on retrieving and storing the correct data for the first few days of the project. 

After I was confident I had the necessary data, I set up my backend over the next few days. I did find this quite difficult and learned that I still need more practice with linking my front-end to my backend so I took some breaks to create css as well. 

The last three days were focused on user and log in sign up as well as polishing up the last of the css and deploying my app to Heroku.

## Major Hurdles and unsolved problems

### Major Hurdles
As mentioned before, I did struggle a bit with setting up the full stack aspect of this application. I do think that this kind of app doesn't really benefit from a backend so I would omit if I was to create a similar project in future.

I did also get flustered with the amount of data and different APIs I had to interact with in order to get the front-end information up as well. In future, I will definitely reading the documentation more carefully.

## Unsolved Problems
A big let down for me is that I was unable to figure out how to style the stat bars properly in the PokemonDetails page using css. I would like them not to go over 100% width so that is something to work on in future.

I also found a last minute bug with the search bar where users aren't able to type in the pokemon they're searching for and would have to manually scroll and look themselves if they wanted to find a pokemon. 

## Future Features
- Set up a feature where users can create and store their own teams
- More search functionalities so users can search Pokemon based on abilities and moves
- Add each pokemon's moves on their indivdual pages
